This is an RPG game. The plan is to have a world to move around in. There is now a boss and a bunch of enemies who run around. The boss will attack you if you get too close. you can throw a projectile by pressing space while moving. you can attack while moving by pressing 'n' to attack directly in the direction of motion with a spear. This direct attack is limited to a + direction. The physics system has 2D inelastic collisions with no regard to collision angle(that may be updated but it does not affect gameplay). The projectiles are created by parametric equations. These parametric equations are what causes the slow load upon starting the program.
